# Facebook Messenger Integration PRD

## Overview
The Facebook Messenger integration enables AnySphere Graph to receive, process, and respond to messages from business-managed Messenger channels. The feature will expose a webhook endpoint that validates Facebook signatures, translate incoming payloads into the platform's unified message schema, and route outbound replies through Facebook's Send API. The integration must offer a fast developer onboarding experience with clear deployment paths for both local experimentation and production.

## Goals
- Provide a reliable bridge between Facebook Messenger conversations and the AnySphere Graph messaging infrastructure.
- Ship a developer experience that works locally via Docker Compose and scales via a managed Railway deployment.
- Document all configuration, deployment, and operational steps so support and solutions engineers can follow a repeatable playbook.

## Non-Goals
- Building a full Messenger bot authoring interface.
- Supporting legacy Facebook apps that do not meet current Graph API requirements.
- Delivering multi-tenant billing or quota enforcement beyond existing platform capabilities.

## Success Metrics
- 95% of Messenger webhook events are processed within 2 seconds end-to-end.
- Messenger-to-platform message delivery errors remain below 0.5% weekly.
- Internal developer onboarding survey yields 4.5+/5 satisfaction with documentation and deployment experience.

```
- `infra/railway/` holds managed deployment manifests and instructions for the shared Railway project.
- `docker-compose.yml` continues to provide the recommended local development and QA environment.
- All Messenger integration source code lives under `apps/messenger-webhook` with shared utilities in `packages/`.

## Documentation
1. Update the integration quickstart to cover:
   - Installing the Railway CLI (`npm i -g railway`) and logging in (`railway login`).
   - Linking the repository to the shared project (`railway link --project messenger-integration`).
   - Running local services with `docker compose up messenger-webhook` for iterative testing.
2. Add an `infra/railway/README.md` with:
   - Environment variable mappings between Railway, Facebook App settings, and the webhook application.
   - Steps for triggering `railway up` to provision the service from `infra/railway/railway.json`.
   - Guidance for viewing logs via `railway logs messenger-webhook` and for rolling back using `railway deployments`.
3. Provide troubleshooting guidance for Messenger webhook validation, Railway secrets, and Docker Compose networking parity.

## Deployment Targets
- **Local / Developer:** Docker Compose orchestrates the webhook app and supporting services (e.g., Postgres, Redis). Developers use `docker compose --profile messenger up` with tunnelled Facebook callbacks via ngrok for webhook verification.
- **Staging and Production:** Railway hosts the containerized webhook service. Deployment artifacts come from `infra/railway/railway.json` and environment configuration lives in Railway secrets. CI promotes builds by running `railway deploy --service messenger-webhook --from build`. Blue/green deploys leverage Railway's automatic service versioning.
- **Observability:** Logs and metrics flow through Railway's dashboard with forwarders to Grafana. Alerts are configured using Railway's integrations for Slack and PagerDuty.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Scaffold & Configuration**
   - Create `infra/railway/railway.json` describing the `messenger-webhook` service, environment variables, Postgres add-on, and health checks.
   - Author `infra/railway/README.md` documenting CLI usage, token management, and deployment workflows.
   - Update `docker-compose.yml` to ensure parity with the Railway service (matching ports, environment, and secrets).
2. **Application Development**
   - Build the webhook receiver with Facebook signature validation middleware and structured logging.
   - Implement outbound message handling with retries that align with Messenger's delivery guarantees.
   - Ensure feature flags and secrets can be injected via Railway environment variables.
3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Extend GitHub Actions to authenticate with Railway using `railway login --token $RAILWAY_TOKEN` and trigger `railway deploy` on tagged releases.
   - Add automated tests to the CI pipeline using `docker compose run` for integration coverage prior to Railway deploys.
   - Store Railway service IDs and environment IDs in repository secrets for reuse across workflows.
4. **Testing & Verification**
   - Validate local flows via Docker Compose and the Graph API test console.
   - Run staging deploys through Railway, verifying health checks, logs, and rollback commands (`railway rollback --service messenger-webhook`).
   - Coordinate with Solutions Engineering to send pilot Messenger conversations through staging prior to production promotion.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Railway resource limits or plan changes** may impact uptime. Mitigation: configure horizontal autoscaling in `railway.json`, monitor usage, and maintain exportable Terraform-equivalent config for migration fallback.
- **CLI authentication churn** could block deploys. Mitigation: rotate Railway tokens regularly, document `railway status` checks in runbooks, and add automated reminders for token renewal.
- **Webhook downtime during deploys** risks Facebook verification failures. Mitigation: rely on Railway's zero-downtime deploy strategy, keep `docker compose` environment ready for emergency failover, and document manual rollback via `railway rollback`.
- **Secrets drift between local and cloud** could introduce inconsistent behavior. Mitigation: manage secrets centrally in Railway, mirror them locally via `.env` templates, and run configuration drift checks in CI.

## Blog Outline
1. **Hook:** Highlight how the team moved from manual Messenger integrations to a standardized deployment via Docker Compose locally and Railway in the cloud.
2. **Problem Statement:** Challenges maintaining webhook infrastructure and aligning local testing with production environments.
3. **Solution Overview:** Describe the new Messenger integration, the Docker Compose developer workflow, and Railway-managed production pipeline.
4. **Technical Deep Dive:**
   - Webhook validation, message translation, and outbound messaging.
   - Infrastructure as code using `infra/railway/railway.json` and CI-driven `railway deploy` commands.
   - Observability and rollback using Railway dashboards.
5. **Results:** Faster onboarding, reduced deploy friction, and improved reliability metrics.
6. **Call to Action:** Encourage developers to try the integration and follow the Railway deployment guide for their own Messenger use cases.
